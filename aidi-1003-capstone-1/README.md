## Capstone Term 1
### AI Project Idea
- This AI project involves building a banking bot that uses artificial intelligence algorithms that analyze user queries to understand their message and accordingly perform the appropriate action. It is a specially designed application for banks where users can ask for bank-related questions like account, loan, credit cards, etc. 
- Like a chatbot, it is trained to process the usersâ€™ queries/requests and understand what services or information they are looking for. The bot will communicate with users like another human being. So, no matter how you ask a question, the bot can answer it and, if required, even escalate issues to human executives. A WebBanking application must be developed to support real life experience.
